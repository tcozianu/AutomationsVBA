**VBA and Selenium Automations**

Welcome to my collection of automation scripts created using VBA and Selenium library!

**Overview**
This repository contains a set of automation scripts developed by me to streamline various tasks using VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) and Selenium WebDriver. 
These scripts automate interactions with web applications, data extraction, processing, and more.

**Contents**
**VBA Scripts:** This folder contains VBA scripts designed to run within Excel workbooks, automating tasks such as data retrieval, manipulation, and reporting.
**Selenium Scripts:** Here, you'll find Selenium scripts, enabling automated testing and web interaction outside of Excel.

**Features**
**Web Automation:** Automate repetitive tasks on web applications, reducing manual effort and errors.
**Data Processing:** Extract, transform, and load data from web sources into Excel workbooks for further analysis.
**Efficiency:** Improve productivity by automating time-consuming tasks and workflows.

**Getting Started**
To use these automation scripts:

Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using Git.
Set Up Dependencies: Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed, such as Selenium WebDriver and appropriate drivers.
Configure Scripts: Modify the scripts as needed, updating parameters, URLs, and file paths to match your environment.
Execute Scripts: Run the scripts within the appropriate environment (Excel for VBA scripts) to start automating tasks.
