This VBA macro automates the process of overriding prices for items listed on an e-commerce marketplace. 

Price Override Handling:

If the item is not found, it records a message indicating the failure to find the item and goes to the next one.                       
If the item is found, it proceeds to override the price.                                      
It enters the override price, start date, end date, reason for override, and confirms the override.
